You can anytime enable the area using the `/afkarea enable` command.

**Restart** your server.

## Deleting Areas
* Run the command `/afkarea delete <area>` to delete an area.
This command **CANNOT** be undone once executed.

**Restart** your server.


## Editing Area
* Run the command `/afkarea edit <area>` to change the coordinates of and area.
The plugin will put you in edit mode to change the area.
* If you dont't see any changes reflect instantly after setting the positions **restart** your server.


## Why do I have to restart the server every time?

The reason you have to restart your server is to not cause any issues after creating or modifying of the area.
The region is partly loaded in the server but to fully load it in you need to restart your server after creating or making changes to the area.

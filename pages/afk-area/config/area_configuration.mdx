# AFK Area Configuration

AFK Areas have a lot of things customizable and more things will be add in the future updates.


## Area Configuration Section

Here is an example region with the name `test` that I configured.

```yaml filename="config.yml"  copy
afk-areas:
  test:
    enabled: true
    world: world
    commands:
      commands:
      - give {player} diamond 1
      - tell {player} Yay! You got diamonds!
      enabled: true
      random:
        enabled: true
        commands:
          command-list-1:
          - give {player} diamond 3
          - tell {player} You got extra diamonds <3
          command-list-2:
          - give {player} gold 3
          - tell {player} You got extra gold <3
    time_required: 10
    title:
      enabled: true
      title: '&2&lAFK AREA'
      subtitle: You will get rewarded every {minutes} minutes
    sound:
      exit:
        enabled: true
        sound_effect: ENTITY_ARROW_HIT_PLAYER
      reward:
        enabled: true
        sound_effect: ENTITY_EXPERIENCE_ORB_PICKUP
      enter:
        enabled: true
        sound_effect: ENTITY_ARROW_HIT_PLAYER
    messages:
      enter_enabled: true
      enter: '{prefix} &aYou entered the AFK Zone you will be rewarded every &b{minutes}
        &aminutes'
      exit_enabled: true
      exit: '{prefix} &cYou &c&lleft &cthe AFK Zone'
      reward_enabled: true
      reward: '{prefix} &aYou completed your AFK time. You got rewarded'
    location:
      minX: -246.0
      minY: 76.0
      minZ: -70.0
      maxX: -253.0
      maxY: 73.0
      maxZ: -58.0
      ```

      Uhhh! That's too much to process right? We offer a lot of customization options. Let's explore slowly.

      ### Commands
      ``` yaml filename="config.yml" copy
      commands:
        commands:
        - give {player} diamond 1
        - tell {player} Yay! You got diamonds!
        enabled: true
        random:
          enabled: true
          commands:
            command-list-1:
            - give {player} diamond 3
            - tell {player} You got extra diamonds <3
            command-list-2:
            - give {player} gold 3
            - tell {player} You got extra gold <3
        ```

    * In the first `commands` list these commands will always be executed when a player completes his AFK Time.
    * In the `random.commands` section there are multiple lists of commands through which randomly one list of commands will be excecuted.
    You can add as much commands as you can in a list and as many lists as possible.

    ### Time Required
      ``` yaml filename="config.yml" copy
          time_required: 10
      ```
    The required time (in minutes) for the player should be AFK to be rewarded.
    The number should be a whole number no decimal digits are allowed and minimum 1 minute is required.

    ### Title
      ``` yaml filename="config.yml" copy
        title:
          enabled: true
          title: '&2&lAFK AREA'
          subtitle: You will get rewarded every {minutes} minutes
      ```

      You can send player a title on entering the AFK Area. This function is toggleable and enabled by default by the plugin.

          ### Sound
      ``` yaml filename="config.yml" copy
        sound:
          exit:
            enabled: true
            sound_effect: ENTITY_ARROW_HIT_PLAYER
          reward:
            enabled: true
            sound_effect: ENTITY_EXPERIENCE_ORB_PICKUP
          enter:
            enabled: true
            sound_effect: ENTITY_ARROW_HIT_PLAYER
      ```

      You can play a sound when a player leaves a AFK Area and also on when he completes his AFK Time. All minecraft sounds are suported with respect 
      to your server version.

      ### Enter, Exit and Reward Messages
        ``` yaml filename="config.yml" copy
        messages:
          enter_enabled: true
          enter: '{prefix} &aYou entered the AFK Zone you will be rewarded every &b{minutes}
            &aminutes'
          exit_enabled: true
          exit: '{prefix} &cYou &c&lleft &cthe AFK Zone'
          reward_enabled: true
          reward: '{prefix} &aYou completed your AFK time. You got rewarded'
      ```

      You can send a message to the player upon entering and leaving the AFK region. Both of the messages are togglable

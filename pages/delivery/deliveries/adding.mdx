# Adding Items to a menu

Now that you've learnt to create custom deliveries let's add them to menus.

You can create menus using the file `menus.yml` located in the plugin's folder.

### Example Menu Configuration

```yaml filename="menus.yml"
custom-menu:
  name: "Menu Name"
  rows: 3
  items:
    delivery-item:
      type: DELIVERY
      slot: 13
      # This is your delivery ID form deliveries.yml
      # Plugin will automatically add the item you configured in the file here
      id: delivery-id
    # You can add same delivery multiple times
    # All the items will be updated automatically on claiming or clicking something.
    # Useful for making custom GUIs
    delivery-item-2:
      type: DELIVERY
      slot: 14
      id: delivery-id

    #Normal Vanilla Item
    close-item:
      type: ITEM
      slot: 22
      material: BARRIER
      name: "&cClose"
      lore:
        - "&fClose the menu."
      item_flags:
        - HIDE_ENCHANTS
      #For more info on Actions refer to actions section in docs
      action:
        - '[CLOSE]'

```

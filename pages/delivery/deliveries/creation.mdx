# Creating custom deliveries

For creating deliveries the file `deliveries.yml` is used. There are already default deliveries configured but if you want to add your own you can!

## Creating a delivery

Creating a custom delivery is simple! Here's a simple example.

```yml filename="config.yml"  copy
custom-delivery:
    claim_interval: 24h
    item:
      material: CHEST_MINECART
      name: "&7Daily Delivery"
      lore:
        - "&fClaim your daily delivery"
        - ""
        - "&eClick here to claim your daily delivery"
    claimed_item:
      material: MINECART
      name: "&7Daily Delivery &e&lCLAIMED"
      lore:
        - "&fYou have claimed your daily delivery please come back later."
        - ""
        - "&cYou have claimed this reward come back in: &f%delivery_remaining_custom-delivery%"
    no_permission_item:
      material: MINECART
      name: "&7Daily Delivery"
      lore:
        - "&fClaim your daily delivery"
        - ""
        - "&cYou don't have permission to claim this reward."
```

There are all the bare required entries for a delivery to work. All the three `item`, `claimed_item` and `no_permission_item` are mandatory to be set.
